# BWIA121 Financial Calculator

## Description
This repository contains a financial calculator developed as part of my first-year financial mathematics course (BWIA121). Built in Microsoft Excel with VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), the calculator provides tools for interest rate conversions, single investment growth, annuities, loans, and retirement planning. It features a user-friendly interface with dynamic tables, graphs, and interactive controls like spin buttons, making it accessible and intuitive for financial calculations.

## Features
- **Interest Rate Conversion**:
  - Converts between different types of interest rates.
  - Calculates the effective interest rate over periods with changing rates via the "Convert Changing Interests" tab.
  - Includes a dynamic timeline for visualizing interest rate changes.
- **Single Investment**:
  - Calculates Future Value (FV), Present Value (PV), interest, and time for single investments.
  - Generates graphs to visualize investment growth.
  - Compares two single investments side by side.
- **Annuities**:
  - Computes FV, PV, interest, payment, and time for annuities (in arrears and advance).
  - Creates dynamic tables for FV with spin button navigation.
  - Generates graphs and includes a retirement planning feature.
- **Loans**:
  - Calculates loan amount, repayment amount, last payment, and loan duration.
  - Provides a scrollable amortization table with interest and capital breakdowns.
  - Allows calculations at a specific time, over a period, or for the total loan using a spin button.
- **User Interface**:
  - Built with VBA user forms for seamless navigation across all features without leaving the active sheet.
  - Interactive controls like spin buttons and dynamic tables enhance usability.
